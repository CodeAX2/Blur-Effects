# Blur-Effects
A cool example of different ways to blur an image. Because of typical blurring algorithms, 
dark edges often occur when two bright colors are adjacent to each other. Using slightly 
different mathematical algorithms, this problem can be solved! 


## About This Project
After watching this video from Minute Physics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKnqECcg6Gw I decided to
impliment their ideas into my own program. The issue outlined in the video pertains to blured colors
appearing darker than they should be. To view this for myself, I created this program that simply
blurs and image using typical bluring, and again using the bluring outlined in the video. The blured
images are then exported to be viewed easily.

## Things I Learned During Development
During creation of this project, I learned common bluring algorithims
as well as how to output images to a file. From watching the video,
I also learned how color is stored and manipulated by computers.
